Methods to solve:
Clue cell solutions - see below
Clue cell constraints - see below
Constraint propagation:
	Constrain row/col based on solved cells in row col
	Process of Elimination: resolve cells when they're the only one left in row/col that can be a value
Row/Col combinatorial exclusion: generate all possible combos for row/col, constrain based on clues
	This can solve some cells (all valid combos have only one value for a cell)
	For others it can cross off values (all valid combos for row/col produce a list of possibles for a cell shorter than the given constraint list for a cell)
Guess / check
	Rather than brute force...
	...sort cells by those which are easiest to resolve
	try solutions, seeing if you produce a constradiction elsewhere
	contraditions take form of constraint lists being empty, having exluded all possible values
	throws an assertion error

Clue Edge Constraints

n clues fill in adjacent row/col with 1 through n
1 clues fill in adjacent cell with n


n - 1 clues exclude ALL values but 1 and 2 in adjacent cell
n - 2 clues exclude ALL but 1, 2, 3 in adjacent cell
n - 3 clues exclude ALL but 1, 2, 3, 4 in adjacent cell
...
n - k clues exclude ALL from 1 to k + 1 in adjacent cell


then:
n - 1 clues exclude ALL from 1 to 3 in second cell in
n - 2 clues exclude ALL from 1 to 4 in second cell in
n - 3 clues exclude All from 1 to 5 in second cell in
...
n - k clues exclude all from 1 to k + 2 in second cell in


n - k clues exclude all from 1 to k + c in cell c from edge


3 cross out values in constraint propagation
4 draw out consequences of constraint propagation
	any cells in which only one value isn't crossed out? DONE
	any numbers in any row/col for which only one cell has that number uncrossed?


****TODO****
Add constraint propagation for two cells at a time?
