n clues fill in adjacent row/col with 1 through n
1 clues fill in adjacent cell with n


n - 1 clues exclude ALL values but 1 and 2 in adjacent cell
n - 2 clues exclude ALL but 1, 2, 3 in adjacent cell
n - 3 clues exclude ALL but 1, 2, 3, 4 in adjacent cell
...
n - k clues exclude ALL from 1 to k + 1 in adjacent cell


then:
n - 1 clues exclude ALL from 1 to 3 in second cell in
n - 2 clues exclude ALL from 1 to 4 in second cell in
n - 3 clues exclude All from 1 to 5 in second cell in
...
n - k clues exclude all from 1 to k + 2 in second cell in 


n - k clues exclude all from 1 to k + c in cell c from edge


3 cross out values in constraint propagation
4 draw out consequences of constraint propagation
	any cells in which only one value isn't crossed out? DONE
	any numbers in any row/col for which only one cell has that number uncrossed?


****TODO****
Add constraint propagation for two cells at a time?
